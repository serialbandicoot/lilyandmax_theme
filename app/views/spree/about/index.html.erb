<h1>About Us</h1>
<div>
    Lily and Max was created from the realisation that throwing a wonderful and special birthday celebration for your little ones can prove difficult and time consuming with very little choice of coordinating partyware readily available out there.
    </br></br>
    My husband and I celebrated our daughters 1st birthday last January, however with her birthday falling so close to Christmas we found it really difficult to find both the time and the lovely items to put together a perfect little birthday party for her. We did manage to have a delightful little tea party for her but we felt we could have made it so much more special if we'd been able to find all the bits and pieces to create a wonderful party. So we've spent the last few months sourcing everything to make your little ones day that little bit more special without you having to dedicate a lot of your time finding everything you need.
    </br></br>
    Our party kits contain only high quality items that beautifully complement each other to make your little ones day all that more memorable. All kits contain a disposable tablecloth, paper plates and cups, bunting or garland, napkins, balloons, balloon ribbon, candles, cake slice boxes and party bags. The deluxe kits include everything from the basic kits plus some perfectly coordinated extras. Invitations and thank you cards are also available. In just a few minutes you can order all the basics to help you create your wonderful party, all you need to do is provide the food, cake, games and fill the party bags with items of your choice. Keep an eye on our blog for tips on partyfood, cakes, games, party bag fillers and other great suggestions.
    </br></br>
    Lily and Max party kits are presented in a beautiful box, tied with ribbon and contain everything you need to get your perfect little party underway.
